168,DIADetroit,"The underdrawing beneath The Wedding Dance is extraordinarily detailed, which is atypical of Bruegel‚Äôs underdrawings.

172,DIADetroit,Bruegel painted The Wedding Dance on an oak panel made from 4 individual boards. Much has happened to it. We were able to determine that the top (5th) section is a later addition.
